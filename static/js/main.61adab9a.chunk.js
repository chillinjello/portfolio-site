If I think about it like that I often wonder if I\u2019m not wasting my time, but I think that the ground retread is often the most important ground, and might deserve to be reiterated by another person of a different generation, class, etc.. But in the case of Homer, I can\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s so much I don\u2019t understand that scholars have been writing about and mulling over in regards to the Iliad that life seems too short to write or read something on Homer by someone who only has just scratched the surface of a poem so at the center of literature. But I will anyway.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"For me the Iliad appeared before reading as influential required reading that, although a bit dusty, was fairly complex and a telling of a powerful story. This would be a great accomplishment for any modern novel, but now, after reading it through, I realize the scope is many times this expected magnitude. The book is religious like the bible, historical like Thucidides, poetic (something which I\u2019m sure differs translation to translation), violent, emotional, and philosophical. The characters are larger than life, distinct, and beg to be made into archetypes. Homer\u2019s take on the siege of Troy is only about three days worth of action but he somehow stuffs every type of struggle, conflict, and loss into these three days. Every element seems large, and somehow this limited personal confrontation with figures like the Atreidae elevates their triumphs and flaws to a nearly metaphysical level. Nearly every aspect of the books is like this.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"I find myself, writing this, wanting to just keep listing the parts of the book that frame the world in these mythological, \u201clarger than life\u201d terms. Homer seems to embody the spirit of poetry even now. He frames things and places us within his world, showing us how things work on a level that could at once be considered religious, artistic, and scientific. There\u2019s no end to his wisdom here. His worldview seeming so lucid as to make us wonder if there isn\u2019t some part of Homer\u2019s world buried deep within us still, but perhaps at that point we should stop thinking of Homer as a single person but as a collection of people or cultures, all pointing towards their goals, worldviews, foundations. This seems to be a poem that people should read, not only because it\u2019s pretty or emotive, but because it feels like a look behind one of the many shrouds that we find human nature obscured by. It\u2019s enlightening in its use of gods, things which might seem fanciful and distant to us now, alongside subjects like honor, death, family, fate, and purpose, things which still exist in our life, though sometimes differently.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"Another thing that surprised me was how incomplete the story felt. The actual narrative starts off 9 years into the Trojan War and requires fair knowledge of what happens before the start of the war (Paris, Agamemnon, Helen, etc), some basic mediterranean geography, knowledge of greek gods (Zeus, Ares, Aphrodite, etc), and some post-Iliad story beats. So, you basically need to know the story before you read it. It\u2019s in some ways an issue, but also makes the story feel somehow open. And reading some Sophocles makes me appreciate that this take on the story doesn\u2019t need to be perfectly accurate. In some ways it\u2019s best to just pay attention to the details and story beats just contained within the Iliad. All the extra-Iliad context is just icing."]});return Object(b.jsx)(W,{title:"Homer - Iliad (7XX BC)",date:"5-15-2022",content:t})},V=function(e){var t=Object(b.jsxs)("p",{children:["I heard Michael Silverblatt describe that books can often be described as falling into two categories: complicated multi-layered chess games and emotional rollercoasters. Stoner is the latter. Where most books take me a couple weeks to finish, Stoner took me three days. I was just stressed out thinking about what would happen next to the protagonist, Stoner, and on the surface the book sounds mundane, dry, made for introspective academics, totally unfit for an amateur looking for an afternoon read.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"The story follows Stoner, a man born on a small Missouri farm in 1891. Once he comes of age he goes to university to study agriculture, but he falls in love with literature and switches majors. He proceeds to spend the rest of his life at the university, first as grad student then as professor, living the most quiet life imaginable. He has an unsatisfactory marriage, literature department quarles, and a chance relationship with a student. Stoner's life is for the most part uneventful, existing in society as a low hum, and ending with a plain, if not pitiful, death sprawled out in a generic mid century hospital.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"Stoner\u2019s plot is on paper stiff, boring, and would make a hard sell sitting on the shelf at any major bookstore. But it\u2019s clear that John Williams\u2019 point exists somewhere in the margins. This might mean there isn\u2019t really a point. Maybe it means the point is to not be like Stoner, or perhaps he\u2019s just a model, someone to idealize, but not actually live like, as clearly his life was awful. (Or was it?) Whatever points John Williams has stuffed into Stoner, the book exists as a middle American cry, one that\u2019s wrapped up in the existentialism of yesteryear and the counterculture critiques of its day. Stoner\u2019s life has a psychedelic quality, but one that\u2019s not detached but instead just like our lives, a giant mirror where we find Stoner looking back at us, lost in the same tornado of life we find ourselves in every morning as we blink back at our aging faces.
